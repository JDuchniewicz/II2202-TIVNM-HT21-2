# Research Methodology and Scientific Writing KTH Course

We will be updating this repository with the content of our research and our progress in the TODO list. This repository contains both the HDL code and Jupyter Notebooks necessary for collection of experimental data.

## Network Choices
(Must fit on either De0-Nano or De2)
We chose Multilayer Perceptron as our implementation target because it is usually the first architecture chosen as the baseline model for the task.

## Implementation decisions
* How to test the network
* How to measure current consumption
* How big network to choose
* How to test it performs properly?
* Should we alter the number of layers dynamically?


# TODO:
- [x] Choose a Network 
- [x] Implement the neuron
- [] Implement the datapath
- [] Imlement the controller
- [] Implement top entity
- [] Implement necessary layer connections and dataflow
- [] Implement loading the weights and biases
- [] Implement loading the test data through network
